Flow

1) Encrypt
Get input txt file
Get input: Encryption value to be used
Encrypt file
Get output txt file

2) Decrypt
Get input txt file
Get input: Decryption value to be used
Decrypt file
Get output txt file

Encryption method
SHA256 -> chacha20 -> file

Current State:
Adding both nonce and Content to output
Extracting both and decrypting
need to check more on salt

ToDo
Add salt when converting password key with SHA-256 to dissuade rainbow tables
Add Nonce Data, Salt to the Encrypted file
While Decryption extract Nonce, Salt and Content separately
